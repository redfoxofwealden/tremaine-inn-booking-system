## About

The Tremaine Inn, a **fictitious** inn, was developed as a student project for the Code Institute.

The Tremaine Inn is where customers can stay the night, have an evening meal or drink, or can have breakfast. The Inn caters mostly to business people, who just stay for one night, so that they can continue their journey to their destination. It also caters to holiday couples, who usually want to stay for one night, so that they can travel through to or return from their destination.

The purpose of the website is to allow the customer to book a room for the night on one or more occasions. The owner hopes that the customer will book the rooms through the website freeing him up to concentrate on managing the more important duties.

From now on in the document the customer will be referred to as the user.

- **NOTE**

The Tremaine Inn and all information about it is completely **fictitious** and **fabricated**.
